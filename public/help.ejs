      <h3>So, how does this work?</h3>
      <br>
      <p><b>If you want to get a book:</b> peruse the 'all books' section, and choose a book. When you hit 'trade', the owner will be messaged and told of the trade. If they accept, then they will get your email and contact you 
      to figure out details. You can then say on the site whether or not you have received the book on your dashboard, and the book will be swapped to your collection.</p>
      <p><b>If you want to trade a book:</b> you can add a book at the 'add book' section. If someone then asks for the book, it will appear on your dashboard, where you can accept the trade. You will be given the email of the person
      who asked for the book, and then you can arrange to send the book on its way!</p>
      <p>To <b>delete</b> a book for any reason from the site, go to the bottom of your dashboard and hit the trashcan.</p>
